Piggy Invaders
===

Piggy invaders is a game inspired by space invaders. In this game there are no aliens invading but piggies!

This is game is a side project i am working on. I am working in unity to make the game.

The gameplay is just shoothing down the waves of pigs that are invading. How fast the pigs spawn is based on your score, the higher your score the faster they spawn.

There are two diffrent types of `enemies`:

`large pigs:` They have two healthpoints and shoot `small pigs`. When killed there is a small chance they drop a piece of ham.
'small pigs' They have one healthpoint and are faster then the `large pigs`

When you pickup a `ham drop` your shoot cooldown is slightly reduced.
